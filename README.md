# 🧠 Geometric Dreaming Intelligence

It is live at: https://anttiluode.github.io/GeometricDreamingIntelligence/

A weird system where "scouts" are particles that track you on screen and form memories. You can also see what is moving as a yellow flashing update on feature field.

## 🎯 What Makes This Special

### The Scout System
This isn't just another computer vision demo - it's a living geometric intelligence with autonomous particles called **"scouts"** that behave like miniature visual cortex neurons:

- **🔴 Edge Scouts** - Track vertical, horizontal, and diagonal edges in real-time
- **🟢 Motion Scouts** - Detect movement in all four directions  
- **🟡 Temporal Scouts** - The special ones! These yellow scouts flash and track what's actually moving in your image, creating dynamic temporal patterns
- **🟣 Texture Scouts** - Analyze surface patterns and textures
- **⚪ Color Scouts** - Respond to brightness and contrast changes

### The Dream Mode 🌙
Cover your camera and watch the magic happen:
- The system enters **autonomous dream mode**
- Scouts begin exploring based on learned memory patterns
- Attractors evolve independently, creating emergent geometric patterns
- Memory patterns persist and influence future dreaming sessions

### Memory Formation 🧠
- **Persistent Memory**: The system forms lasting memories of visual patterns
- **VAE-like Architecture**: Associations between visual input and geometric attractors
- **Save/Load States**: Export and import memory configurations
- **Temporal Coherence**: Memory patterns evolve over time, creating continuity

## 🎮 How to Experience It

1. **Allow camera access** when prompted
2. **Let it learn** - Move around, show it objects, let it see your environment for 30+ seconds
3. **Watch the scouts** - See how different colored particles track different visual features
4. **Pay attention to yellow flashes** - These indicate motion detection in real-time
5. **Cover the camera** - Use your hand or tape to block the camera
6. **Enter dream mode** - Watch as the system begins autonomous exploration
7. **Save memories** - Export interesting memory states for later

## 🔬 Technical Innovation

### Minimodel Architecture
Each scout type acts as a specialized "minimodel" similar to neurons in the visual cortex:
- **Receptive Fields**: Each scout responds to specific visual features
- **Population Dynamics**: Scouts cluster and interact based on activation patterns
- **Emergent Intelligence**: Complex behaviors emerge from simple scout interactions

### Geometric Memory System
- **Psi Field**: A geometric field that captures visual essence
- **Attractor Dynamics**: Memory stored as evolving geometric attractors
- **Feature Maps**: Separate processing channels for edges, motion, color, and texture
- **Temporal Integration**: Past and present visual information blend seamlessly

### Real-time Processing
- **256x256 Processing Grid**: High-resolution analysis at 60fps
- **4000+ Active Scouts**: Massive parallel processing
- **Multiple Visualization Layers**: See the system's "thoughts" in real-time

## 🎨 Visual Interface

The interface shows six synchronized views:
1. **Visual Input** - What the camera sees
2. **Feature Field** - Processed visual features (with yellow motion flashes!)
3. **Scout Population** - Live scout movements and activations
4. **Active Attractors** - Current geometric attention patterns
5. **Memory Patterns** - Long-term geometric memories
6. **Control Panel** - Scout type toggles and system controls

## 🛠 Technology Stack

- **React 19** - Modern UI framework
- **Canvas API** - High-performance real-time rendering
- **WebRTC** - Camera access and video processing
- **Custom Algorithms** - Proprietary scout dynamics and memory formation
